<b>Project Name:** Petrol Price Forecasting  using Tensor Flow and Auto Keras.<b>
Petrol Prices are going up continously these days and it has become very hard to predict what will be the price range in the next few months or even days.
In this project we will try to forecast the different petrol prices for the upcoming dates given to us. 
We will use LSTM and ARIMA forecasting models to predict the prices then we will see how we can implement the same using Auto Keras, which is an Auto ML Library.
